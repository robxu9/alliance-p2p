<h1>Introduction</h1>

Alliance takes the best from !BitTorrent, !DirectConnect and WASTE and creates a decentralized and secure P2P network. It is a private and secure environment to share files and communicate with people you know. Alliance works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

<h1>Connecting</h1>

~~Currently you cannot connect to Alliance on the wireless networks; you must use the LAN through Ethernet. We're trying to solve this issue as quickly as possible, check back for updates.~~

<font color="red"><b>2/28 Update: Alliance now seems to work on the !WolfieNet wireless networks, so if !WiFi is working for you (it's been erratic lately) Alliance should too.</b></font>
