#summary Feature requests, including changes/bugfixes to current features.

Read through the comments on [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/list issues with the beta] (1.2.0-pre build 1280). Some feature requests and bugfixes were already under development.

If you're working on a feature, claim it here so we don't duplicate work. Once you're done, cross the item out. After we release a version with that feature included, the item can just be deleted.

= Feature requests =

Things on this list are pretty major features, so no need to add them all in one update.

 * Replace the chat system with the [http://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/jb9jx/there_is_a_stony_brook_irc_channel_if_anyone_is/ #sbu IRC channel] using [http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php PircBot].
 * Admin-only powers. This is difficult since Alliance isn't centralized; if we add IRC, that uses a central server so we could identify admins that way.
    * Silence users from chat or ban them entirely. A banlist should get propagated to all users.
    * Send mass PMs to everyone.
       * It looks like this was already started; look in !MessageBoard.java.
    * Appoint moderators who get some admin powers.
 * Let clients with different encryption levels communicate (as per [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/detail?id=6 this issue]), which would also let us easily transition to the "experimental" AES option.
 * Fix the LAN option so only on-campus people can connect; somehow COner is still connecting despite being off-campus.
 * Monitor selected users for new files
    * There's a [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/detail?id=36 plugin] being developed for that.
 * Do something more useful with the star-ranking system than just showing who invited the most users.
    * I was thinking it could be based on share size, but with the "sort by share size" option that's redundant.
    * How about like DC++? Different colors for dead, offline, regular, and admin users. (Admins would be red, to match their chat color.) And this way admins would appear on top.
 * ~~When you start up Alliance, try connecting to previously-online users first and "dead" ones last (so time isn't wasted trying to connect to someone who's been gone for weeks).~~

These are things that could probably be implemented quickly.

 * Pause and resume downloads.
 * Add a Help menu. The items:
    * Help: links to [http://www.sbushare.com/ sbushare.com] and this wiki.
    * About: shows the current version and build number, and lists the program authors.
    * Check for updates: move this here from the Tools menu.
 * User status messages like on DC++.
    * Lots of user information is currently visible as a tooltip; maybe we could move it into a popup dialog, along with a status message, opened via one of the context menu items.
    * The "offline for N days" text could also go in this popup. Right now it makes the user list too wide and it scrolls horizontally.
 * Highlight your own chat lines somehow; maybe make them bold, or italic, or black.
    * I think users like knowing their own color, though, so maybe keep their name colored and make their text black?
 * Assign aliases to shared folders like DC++.
 * In search results, show which users are sharing the files (as a tooltip?).
    * Oh, this is already shown when you hover over a file name (not a directory name). It's not a great display though.
 * Show extensions in search results for all files.
 * Resizing columns in the tabs behaves weirdly. 
 * Add a "Time started" column to the Uploads tab.
 * Clicking a column in the Uploads and Downloads tabs should sort by it.
 * More filetype icons for common extensions: exe, pdf, mobi, lit, 7z
 * If the user scrolls the chat window up to read old entries, don't scroll it back down when a new message appears
    * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2039373/maintaing-jtextarea-scroll-position
    * http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=16674
 * ~~Update users' nicknames when refreshing the user list.~~
 * ~~Fix searching so "hello world" will match "hello.world" and "Hello, world" (i.e. use regex).~~
 * ~~Allow user list to be sorted by name or by share size, not by ranking.~~
 * ~~Add a "check for updates" menu item.~~
 * ~~Make chat history length a user setting.~~
    * ~~Also make the default chat length 100, not 50; the chat history length of 500 is fine, since it already takes a second or so to load.~~
 * ~~I found two more _%Missing translation!%s_ -- open the View -> Invitations tab and hover over the buttons.~~
    * ~~And some more when you right-click a friend to "Edit hostname."~~
 * ~~Fix the "invite a friend" message to mention sbushare.com, not alliancep2p.com.~~
 * ~~More chat colors.~~
 * ~~Change the Debug console shortcut to Ctrl+K, since Ctrl+D is used for Duplicate files~~

= Bugs =

Note that some [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/list old ones] might still not be fixed.

 * !BufferUnderflowException when someone connects to you.
 * !NullPointerException when you try to connect to your own connection code.
