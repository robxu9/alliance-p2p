#summary Feature requests, including changes/bugfixes to current features.

Read through the comments on [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/list issues with the beta] (1.2.0-pre build 1280). Some feature requests and bugfixes were already under development.

If you're working on a feature, claim it here so we don't duplicate work. Once you're done, cross the item out. After we release a version with that feature included, the item can just be deleted.

= Feature requests =

Things on this list are pretty major features, so no need to add them all in one update.

 * Replace the chat system with the [http://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/jb9jx/there_is_a_stony_brook_irc_channel_if_anyone_is/ #sbu IRC channel] using [http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php PircBot].
 * ~~Admin-only powers. This is difficult since Alliance isn't centralized; if we add IRC, that uses a central server so we could identify admins that way.~~
    * ~~Silence users from chat or ban them entirely. A banlist should get propagated to all users.~~
    * ~~Send mass PMs to everyone.~~
      * ~~It looks like this was already started; look in !MessageBoard.java.~~
    * Appoint moderators who get some admin powers.
    * ~~Admins can ban users~~
    * ~~Silence users~~
      * ~~For the above 3 we need to create a ban/silence list for each specific user that'll save locally on their machine.~~
 * Let clients with different encryption levels communicate (as per [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/detail?id=6 this issue]), which would also let us easily transition to the "experimental" AES option.
 * Fix the LAN option so only on-campus people can connect; somehow COner is still connecting despite being off-campus.
 * Monitor selected users for new files
    * There's a [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/detail?id=36 plugin] being developed for that.

These are things that could probably be implemented quickly.

 * ~~Pause and resume downloads.~~
 * ~~User status messages like on DC++.~~
    * ~~Lots of user information is currently visible as a tooltip; maybe we could move it into a popup dialog, along with a status message, opened via one of the context menu items.~~
    * ~~The "offline for N days" text could also go in this popup. Right now it makes the user list too wide and it scrolls horizontally.~~
 * Assign aliases to shared folders like DC++.
 * ~~More filetype icons for common extensions:~~
    * These still need icons to be drawn instead of the placeholders.
    * ~~Programs: exe, com, bin, app, bat, jar~~
    * ~~Comics: cbr, cbz~~
    * ~~Games: rom, n64, nes, sav~~
    * ~~Installers: msi, pkg, deb, rpm, torrent~~
    * ~~Bad files: tmp, part~~
 * In search results, show which users are sharing the files (as a tooltip?).
    * Oh, this is already shown when you hover over a file name (not a directory name). It's not a great display though.
 * Resizing columns in the tabs behaves weirdly. 
 * Add a "Time started" column to the Uploads tab.
 * Clicking a column in the Uploads and Downloads tabs should sort by it.
 * If the user scrolls the chat window up to read old entries, don't scroll it back down when a new message appears

= Bugs =

Note that some [http://code.google.com/p/alliancep2pbeta/issues/list old ones] might still not be fixed.

 * People don't connect to everyone, at least not quickly.
 * !BufferUnderflowException when someone connects to you.
 * !NullPointerException when you try to connect to your own connection code.
 * Chat history file never gets limited, and large ones can freeze Alliance.
 * The automatic database compacting hangs the UI.
 * I think files marked as 'external' still get unhashed.
 * ~~Your own status doesn't appear until after you've opened the Options dialog, and I haven't tested other users' status.~~
